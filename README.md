# schrodingerSolver
Using the inverse power method to solve the schrodinger equation for an arbitrary potential.
Returns an approximate eigenvalue and eigenfunction.

eigen.c works for radial potentials and currently implements the Morse potential.

pendulo.c implements the quantum pendulum potential

doblehorrible.c implements the sum of the hydrogen atom potential and the harmonic oscillator potential. This equation is usually solved with perturbation theory.
